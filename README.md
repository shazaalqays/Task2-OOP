# Introduction to OOP
object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods. Object-oriented programming has several advantages:

* OOP is faster and easier to execute.
* OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.
* OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug.
* OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.

Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.
